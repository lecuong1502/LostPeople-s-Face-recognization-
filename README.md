# LostPeople-s-Face-recognization-

1. Purpose:
    - Build an face-recognizing system that can find and compare the face of the lost person.
    - System can recognize and predict the change of the face at many time periods.
    - Provide a fundamental to help us search efficiently and rapidly for the organizations and families.

2. Technologies:
    - Deep Learning: Uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) models to extract and analyze facial features.

    - Facial recognition system: Integrates advanced facial recognition algorithms such as FaceNet, ArcFace, or DeepFace. These algorithms will encode the face into a digital vector (embedding) for easy comparison.

    - Image processing software: OpenCV, Dlib to detect faces, normalize size, and align before feeding into the deep learning model.

3. Architecture:
    a. Preprocessing Module:
    - Face Detection: Automatically find and crop faces from images.
    - Face Alignment: Rotate and adjust faces to a standard position, making it easier for the model to learn.
    - Data Augmentation: Create new versions of images (rotate, flip, change brightness...) to enrich the training dataset.

    b. Feature Extraction Module:
    - Use a pre-trained CNN model to extract important features of the face, creating a unique feature vector for each face.

    c. Matching and Search Module:
    - Use a vector matching algorithm (e.g. cosine comparison) to find the most similar face in the database.

    - Use efficient search algorithms such as KD-tree or Annoy to speed up searching in large databases.

    d. Face Aging Prediction Module:
    - This is an advanced module that uses Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to predict how a personâ€™s face will change over time.

    - Given a photo of a lost person as a child, the system will generate predicted photos of them as an adult, making the search more accurate.
